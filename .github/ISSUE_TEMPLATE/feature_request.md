Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
A clear and concise description of the problem. Example: “I want to upload large group photos, but the current face detection either crashes or is very slow. Also, I’d like to quickly find a particular person’s face in group images.”

Describe the solution you’d like
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen or how you’d like the system to work. Example: “Support for uploading and processing images over 20MP without crashing, and the ability to search for and highlight a target person in the uploaded photo.”

Describe alternatives you’ve considered
Any alternative solutions or features you have considered, even if you don’t think they’re as good as your main suggestion?
Example: “I have tried manually cropping big images or running detection on image tiles, but it’s tedious and error-prone.”

Additional context
Anything else we should know? Upload screenshots, sample image URLs, or describe real-world use cases as needed.
